cuda-convnet2
=============

cuda-convnet2, fork of https://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet2/

This is an update to cuda-convnet.

This project has three major new features relative to cuda-convnet:

- Improved training times on Kepler-generation Nvidia GPUs (Geforce Titan, K20, K40).
- Multi-GPU training support implementing data parallelism, model parallelism, and the hybrid approach described in One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks.
- Less-polished code and incomplete (but improving) documentation.
